# Clustering Models and Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a clustering and dimensionality reduction task using the provided dataset.

## Dataset
- Dataset Link: [Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset...)

## Task Overview
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues.
   - Apply techniques to handle categorical variables if necessary.

2. **Clustering Models:**
   - Implement the following clustering models:
     - K-Means Clustering
     - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
     - Mean Shift Clustering

3. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
   - Choose an appropriate number of principal components based on the explained variance.
   - Re-implement the clustering models (K-Means, DBSCAN, Mean Shift) on the reduced-dimensional data.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning (if applicable):**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for clustering algorithms if they have hyperparameters.
   - Document the hyperparameters tuned and the reasoning behind the choices.

5. **Model Comparison:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each clustering model on the original and reduced-dimensional datasets.
   - Use appropriate clustering evaluation metrics (e.g., silhouette score) to assess the quality of clusters.
   - Provide a detailed comparison across models, discussing their strengths, weaknesses, and any interesting observations.

## Files Included
- Code for implementing clustering models and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- README.md (this file) providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
- Python
- Relevant Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
